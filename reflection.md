- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Having pre-exisiting methods and attributes definitely help a bit when writing additional classes. I also just think it's cool to be able to use methods on new classes without having to rewrite them. The hardest part for me has been remembering where to write super(), extends, etc., but other than that it feels pretty straightforward. I'm interested to see more complex examples of inheritance & just get more practice with it in general. My best advice is to just read through the directions carefully, pay attention to methods already written for the parent class vs. those that need to be given to the child, and be thoughtful when making use of methods given to pre-existing Java classes (ArrayList, etc.).
